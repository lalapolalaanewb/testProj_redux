## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Software you need to install:-

- Node.js at [Node.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Visual Studio Code at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- or you can choose any Code Editor to your liking

```
Go to Node.org link above and choose your machine type (Please choose the **LTS download version** instead of the Current version):-
- Window, go for Windows Installer
- MacOS, go for MacOS Installer
```

### Installing

Please follow the step below to get the system running

1. After download or git repo the _Project file_. Place your _Project folder_ anywhere in your system (doesn't matter where actually)
2. Open your _Code Editor_ (Visual Studio Code or any other code editor)
3. Go to your _Terminal_ in Visual Studio Code or open _CMD - Command Prompt_, manuver to where your _Project folder_ located and do the following installation:- (make sure you already inside your Project folder. Eg: C:\parentFolder\ProjectFolder)

```
in your Terminal or CMD, it's gonna look like this:-
C:\parentFolder\ProjectFolder\>

```

```
// for server dependencies installation
C:\parentFolder\ProjectFolder\> npm install

// for client dependencies installation
C:\parentFolder\ProjectFolder\client> npm install
```

- Once installation finishes with no errors. Then start the project (in development build - **this will run both the server & client side of the project**):-

```
C:\parentFolder\ProjectFolder\> npm run dev
```
